# AI FOR ADMINISTRATION: Making AI Assistance Available

## Making AI Assistance Available in the Saarland Administration on an Open Source Basis

### Mentor
- **Frank Heil** - Head of D/7 AI, Data, and New Technologies (MWIDE)

## The Challenge

**F13** â€“ a sovereign AI assistant from the administration for the administration, which has been open for collaborative projects as an open source development since July 2025. F13 can be used as an example/basis for creating AI use cases for the use of AI in administration.

F13 is a completely sovereign and model-agnostic AI assistant that can be operated on its own infrastructure and was developed by the administration for the administration. Saarland has been participating and using the F13 AI assistant since the beginning of April 2025 with the modules chat, summary, research, and soon transcription.

## Key Questions

What innovative use cases for the administration are conceivable with F13?

- Where can advantages over public AI assistants for administration be conceived and, if necessary, developed?
- Is there a USP case for F13 in administration?

## Specific Project: Knowledge Loss Due to Demographic Change

At the same time, an initial project based on the F13 tech stack is addressing, among other things, the impending loss of knowledge in the public sector due to demographic change (permanent or temporary vacancies).

### Central Question
How can an AI-supported solution systematically capture, process, and make knowledge accessible?

### Example Scenario

A new employee is in the training phase and is looking for information about processes in their department:
- How did previous colleagues work?
- What needs to be considered?
- How can efficient and fast training (partly through self-study) be achieved?

### Ideas for an Approach

- Interview tools for offboarding and modular use
- Process visualization
- AI-supported knowledge databases
- Interactive learning modules for new employees

## Challenge Goal

Develop innovative use cases, concepts, or prototypes that:
- Optimally utilize the capabilities of F13
- Ensure sovereignty and data protection
- Solve practical problems of administration
- Promote knowledge transfer and efficiency

**Shape the future of digital administration with sovereign AI!**
