# DATA Challenge: Making Smart Use of Open Administrative Data

## Your IT Knowledge for a Good Data View

### Mentors
- **Tony Poesch** - Geodata Coordinator at LHS Saarbrücken
- **Rasha Abuqasem** - Smart City Project at LK WND

## The Challenge

Data is the keyword – did you know that a lot of administrative data is publicly available? Data is the new gold – but for many potential users, it often presents challenges: it is too technically complex and not compiled in a way that is useful for their own purposes.

**Find solutions** for how open data from the administration can be made practical and usable:
- What data do you need right now?
- How do you access it?
- And how do you compile it in a way that is easy to use?

## Example Scenario

A local government employee wants to analyse data from past heat waves and/or severe weather events in the context of urban development – but without quick, user-friendly access to data from various sources, this remains only theoretical.

### Possible Solution Approach

For example, develop an interface that can aggregate, evaluate, and/or visualize data:
- Select exactly the types of data needed
- Search publicly accessible databases
- Generate a user-friendly overview in a dashboard

This makes publicly available data and access more quickly usable – for individual needs.

## Important!

Our mentors will show you:
- Which data portals exist
- Which data is accessible
- And they are happy to discuss this with you!

## Challenge Goal

In this challenge, develop **tools, concepts, or processes** that break down barriers and consider:
- User-friendliness
- Low-threshold feasibility of data requests

## Why This Is Important

Whether citizens, company representatives, or employees, everyone is calling for modern and digital administration – innovative digitization in administration requires smart data and ways to use it.
